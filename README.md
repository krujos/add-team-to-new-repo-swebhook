#Github web hook to add a team on repo create
At [Pivotal](http://pivotal.io) we use this web hook to add teams who are not owners but still need commit rights to our repos every time we create one. This code runs in [Cloud Foundry](http://run.pivotal.io) and uses environment variables to source the teams to add when the web hook is called. 

This is a generic app that should serve the same need for any github org.

##Getting started
* Make sure you have an account on [run.pivotal.io](http://run.pivotal.io) or other another Cloud Foundry provider. 
* Target the org and space you want to use 
  * ```cf target -o <your org> -s <your space>``` 
* Create a personal access token on [github](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the admin:org permission 
* Clone this repo, export the needed environment variables, generate a manifest, push the app to [Cloud Foundry](http://run.pivotal.io)

```

```

* Register your web hook at github for your org.
  * Navigate to your org's webhook settings (https://github.com/organizations/<your org>/settings/hooks)
  * Click "Add webhook"
  * Type in the URL from your push (http://mywebhook.cfapps.io)
  * Make sure "application/json" is selected as the content type. 
  * Type in the same secret that you exported above in ```GITHUB_SECRET```
  * Choose the "Let me select individual events" radio button 
  * Check repository, make sure all other events are unchecked.
  * Make sure the webhook is marked active at the bottom of the form "Add web hook"
  
##Environment variables

```GITHUB_SECRET``` is the secret you expect to be sent with the web hook. If the secret does not match ``X-Hub-Signature`` header in the incoming hook the request is dropped. 

```GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN``` is the personal access token to use for accessing the repo to add a collaborator. You can create a new token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). My access token has the ```admin:org``` permission. 

```GITHUB_COLLABORATOR``` is the id of the team you want to add to the new repo. You can obtain that by running ```curl https://<access_token>@api.github.com/orgs/<your_org>/teams``` and looking for the ```id``` attribute of the team you're interested in. 

```APP_NAME``` is the application name to use when pushing to Cloud Foundry. 

```APP_ROUTE``` is the subdomain to name when pushing, e.g. ``<whatever>.cfapps.io``. If this variable is not set it defaults to the app name

The app itself relies on the ```GITHUB_*``` variables and they must be set at runtime. The ``APP_*``` variables are only used to generate the manifest. 

##Manifest generator
There's a manifest generator to help with deploying the webhook consistently. We generate it because hardcoding your access key and checking it in is a bad idea. The permissions granted to this token can cause a fair bit of damage if used maliciously. The token's pretty much a password and should be guarded as such.
